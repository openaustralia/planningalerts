      Home > Council > Our Organization > Councillors
    = image_tag asset_path("guide/councillors_2.png"), size: "900x400"
    %br
    %h4

    %p
      Then finally, you will see a list of councillor information!
    %h3
      Finding the councillor information
    %p
      What we want is:
      %ul
        %li
          Name of the councillor
        %li
          Email address of the councillor
    = image_tag asset_path("guide/councillorInfo.png"), size: "900x400"

    %p
      Keep:
    %ul
      %li
        Specialized charactors in the name (ex. hyphens "-", equal "=")
      %li
        Capitalization, but not ALL capitals (x jane green, x JANE GREEN,  &radic; Jane Green )

    %p
      Leave:
    %ul
      %li
        Titles (x Cr. Grant Henley -> %radic; Grant HEnley, x Dr. John Trembley -> &Radic; John Trembley,
        x Load Mayor Alderman Sue Hickey -> &radic; Sue Hickey )

    %h3
      Inputting the councillor information
    %p
      Make sure there is ONE space between the first name and the last name
    = image_tag asset_path("guide/contributionInput.png"), size: "700x400"

    %p
      Then input the email of the councillor. If you choose to copy and paste the address,
      your mailor may open up if the councillor's email address is a link. To avoid opening up your
      mailor and copy the email address, use command + click to open the menu and
      choose "Copy Email Address".
    = image_tag asset_path("guide/councillorEmail.png"), size: "700x400"
    %br
    = image_tag asset_path("guide/emailCopyCommand.png"), size: "700x400"
    %br
    %br
    %p
      If you have more than 2 councillor information to submit, hit "Submit Another Councillor" and repeat the process. Once you finish inputting
      the information, click "Submit (number) of councillors information" button
    %h3
      After you submit
    %p
      You will be redirected to the page that asks your contact information.
      This is for us to keep you updated when your contribution goes live, and also to send you a little thank you message and
      %strong this information is optional.
