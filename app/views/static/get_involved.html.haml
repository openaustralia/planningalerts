  PlanningAlerts.org.au is run by a charity, <a href="http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au">the OpenAustralia Foundation</a>,
  and relies on the support of volunteers and <a href="http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/donate/">donations</a> from people
  like you. If you would like to get involved we'd love to hear from you:
%h4
  I am a programmer and want to add my local planning authority
%p
  You can help by writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screen scraper</a>
  for your local planning authority that we can import into planningalerts.org.au. There are only 2 criteria for the
  screen scraper:
%ol
  %li
    That it can output data in the following format: <a href="/brisbane.xml">brisbane.xml</a>
  %li
    That it can accept a query string in the format day=X&amp;month=Y&amp;year=Z
%p
  Other than that it's up to you. It can be in any language. You can host them yourself or we can host it for you.

  I work for a local council or planning authority and would like to make our data available
%p
  The most important thing you can do is publish your data in a simple format that is freely available on the internet.
  Something <a href="/brisbane.xml">like this</a> is good but we can work with most formats. Please
  #{link_to "get in touch", about_path(:anchor => "contact")} if you would like to discuss how you can help.
