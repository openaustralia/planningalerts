  You can lobby your local council to publish its planning data in a machine readable format. Email the council planning department and General Manager. Contact your councillors and get them to support your mission.

%h4#donation
  I don't have the time or I don't have the skills. How can I help?
%p
  If you value the service provided by PlanningAlerts but simply don't have the time or
  the specialist skills to help out personally then the best thing that you can do is
  to #{link_to "donate to the OpenAustralia Foundation", donate_path},
  the charity behind PlanningAlerts.
%p.cta
  Your donation will go to improving the service.

%h4#council
  I work for a local council or planning authority and would like to make our data available
%p
  The most important thing you can do is publish your data in a simple format that is freely available on the internet.
  Something <a href="/brisbane.xml">like this XML</a> is good but we can work with most formats.
  If you decide to use our XML format then we also have a simple free online tester available. Simply plug in the URL of your feed and check that it's all okay. The feed tester is available at #{link_to test_feed_authorities_url, test_feed_authorities_path}.

%p.cta
  Please
  = mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "get in touch"
  if you would like to discuss how you can help.
