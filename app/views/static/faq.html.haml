    What does PlanningAlerts do?
  %dd
    It sends you emails of any planning and development applications we find based on the address you give us when you
    sign up.
  %dt
    Where does the data come from?
  %dd
    We search as many planning authority websites as we can find and forward the data on to you.
  %dt
    What's a planning authority?
  %dd
    Your local planning authority is the part of government that assesses planning and development applications.
    Depending on where you live, this might be your local council or territory government.
  %dt
    How can I stop receiving alerts?
  %dd
    At the bottom of each email you receive there is a link to unsubscribe from that alert. Just click on it and we'll
    delete your alert.
  %dt
    Do you cover the whole country?
  %dd
    No, but we are working on it. There is a list of the planning authorities we currently cover
    #{link_to "here", authorities_path}. Not every planning authority publishes their planning data
    online so some places will always be missing. If your local authority is missing, you could always
    #{mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "help out by writing a screen scraper to search their website."}
  %dt#broken_scraper
    The data in my local area seems out of date. What's going on?
  %dd
    We use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screen scrapers</a> to gather planning data from
    local councils and from time to time their website may change and break our scraper. You can help by providing
    a
    = link_to "donation", donate_path
    or
    #{link_to "volunteering", get_involved_path} to help us fix it.
  %dt
    Can I help?
  %dd
    Yes please! To be able to cover the whole country we need help in writing screen scrapers to search the websites of
    every planning authority in the country. If you'd like to write one for your local planning authority
    #{mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "get in touch"}.
  %dt
    Can I have a copy of your data?
  %dd
    Yes. You can use our #{link_to "API", api_howto_path}.
  %dt
    What kind of license is your data available under?
  %dd
    The data via the #{link_to "API", api_howto_path} is licensed under the
    <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license</a>.

  %dt
    The link to the council development application doesn't take me directly there. What's going on?
  %dd
    Some council web sites require you to click an Agree button before you can view the details of the development
    application. The problem is they often do not redirect you to your original destination after you click Agree.
    Usually revisiting the original link again after clicking Agree should take you to the correct details page.

    %dt#disclosure
      Why do I need to disclose if I've made a donation to a Councillor and/or gift to a Councillor or Council employee
      when commenting on a planning application?
    %dd
      In NSW, for example, it is an offence if you fail to disclose this when making a submission under the
      <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s147.html">Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</a>.
      If this applies to you, please ensure you contact the council responsible so that you can make this disclosure.
    %dt#address
      Why do you need my address when I comment on an application?
