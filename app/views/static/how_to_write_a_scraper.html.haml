%h4 What are scrapers?
%p
  To be able to display and send alerts for development applications (DAs), PlanningAlerts needs to download DAs from as many councils as possible. As the vast majority of councils don't supply DA data in a reusable,
  machine-readable format we need to write
  = link_to "web scrapers", "https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Web_scraping"
  for each local government authority.
%p
  These scrapers fetch the data from council web pages and present it in a structured format so we can load it into
  the PlanningAlerts database.

%h4 How can I help?
%p
  If you have some computer programming experience, you should be able to work out how to prepare a scraper for
  PlanningAlerts. By using our preferred scraping technology,
  #{link_to "ScraperWiki", "https://scraperwiki.com/"}, you can write a scraper using nothing but your web browser.
%p
  The next thing to do is to decide what council to scrape. Once you've picked one, look it up on
  our
  = link_to "crowd-sourced list of councils", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmvYMal8CGUsdG1tM0lEWUctR194eGN6bUh0VGFfc1E"
  and have a look at their published DAs. Quickly double-check that the council isn't #{link_to "covered already", authorities_path}.

%h4 Now it's time to scrape
%p
  With ScraperWiki, you can choose to write your scraper in Ruby, Python or PHP so there's a good chance
  you're already familiar an available programming language.
%p
  Once you've decided on a language, create your own ScraperWiki account and create a new scraper that
  downloads and saves the following information:

%h5 council_reference (Required)
%p
  The ID that the council has given the development application. This also must be the unique key for this data
  set.

%h5 address (Required)
%p
  The physical address that this application relates to. This will be geocoded so doesn't need to be a specific format but obviously the more explicit it is the more likely it will be successfully geo-coded.

%h5 description (Required)
%p
  A text description of what the development application seeks to carry out.

%h5 info_url (Required)
%p
  A URL that provides more information about the development application.
%p
  This should be a persistent URL that preferably is specific to this particular DA. In many cases councils force
  users to click through a license to access DAs, in this case be careful about what URL you provide. Test clicking the link in a browser that hasn't established a session with the council's site to ensure users of PlanningAlerts will be able to click the link and not be presented with an error.

%h5 comment_url (Required)
%p
  A URL where users can provide a response to council about this particular DA.
%p
  As in info_url this needs to be a persistent URL and should be specific to this particular DA if possible.
  Email mailto links are also valid in this field.

%h5 date_scraped (Required)
%p
  Use the following Ruby code:
  %code Date.today.to_s
%p
  (make sure you add
  %code require "date"
  at the top)

%h5 date_received (Optional)
%p
  The date this application was received by council.

%h5 on_notice_from (Optional)
%p
  The date from when public submissions can be made about this development application.

%h5 on_notice_to (Optional)
%p
  The date until when public submissions can be made about this development application.

%p
  To ensure the date_scraped field isn't overwritten on subsequent scrapes add code similar to this to
  save your DAs to the ScraperWiki datastore:

%pre
  :preserve
    if (ScraperWiki.select("* from swdata where
    `council_reference`='\#{record['council_reference']}'").empty? rescue true)
      ScraperWiki.save_sqlite(['council_reference'], record)
    else
      puts "Skipping already saved record " + record['council_reference']
    end

%p
  If you get stuck, have a look at
  = link_to "the scrapers already written for PlanningAlerts", "https://scraperwiki.com/tags/planningalerts"
  and email
  = link_to "community mailing list", "http://groups.google.com/group/openaustralia-dev"
  if you have any questions.

%h4 Finishing up
%p
  Once you've finished your scraper and it's successfully downloading development applications, simply
  email the OpenAustralia Community mailing list or
  = mail_to "contact@planningalerts.org.au", "contact@planningalerts.org.au"
  and we'll add it to the next run.
%p
  The last thing to do is look up on Wikipedia how many people live in the LGA you've just covered so you can
  pat yourself on the back knowing that you've just helped tens of thousands of people get PlanningAlerts.
