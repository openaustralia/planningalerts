%p
  Here are just a few of the arguments that you can use when lobbying your local authority to publish its planning data in a machine readable format. These are jumping off points to get you started.

  Be prepared for the first response being "No". That's normal. Have your arguments ready and be persistent.

  Use Mosman Council as an example of what good local authorities can do. They provide a #{link_to "list of machine readable feeds", "http://portal.mosman.nsw.gov.au/pages/xc.track/ChooseFeed.aspx"} which are licensed under a #{link_to "Creative Commons licence", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/"}.

  of 2010 in which it was stated that the government supports
