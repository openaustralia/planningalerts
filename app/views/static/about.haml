  You'd probably know if your next door neighbour was going to knock their house down (you'd get a letter through

  PlanningAlerts.org.au is a free service which searches as many planning authority websites as it can find and emails
  you details of applications near you. The aim of this to enable shared scrutiny of what is being built (and
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kentjohnson/3634555801/" title="Carlton and United Brewery Site, Broadway Sydney">knocked down</a>)
  in peoples' communities.

  PlanningAlerts.org.au is brought to you by the charity the
  <a href="http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au">OpenAustralia Foundation</a>. The initial prototype was developed
  with financial assistance from the Australian
  <a href="http://gov2.net.au/blog/2009/09/22/allocating-the-project-fund-we-want-your-ideas/#comment-4672">Government 2.0 Taskforce</a>.
  It was adapted for Australia by Matthew Landauer and Katherine Szuminska, and is based on the UK site
  <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com">PlanningAlerts.com</a>, built by Richard Pope, Mikel Maron, Sam Smith,
  Duncan Parkes, Tom Hughes and Andy Armstrong.

  PlanningAlerts.org.au keeps getting better thanks to the contributions from the volunteers:
