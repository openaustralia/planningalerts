  PlanningAlerts is a free service which searches as many planning authority websites as it can find and emails
  you details of applications near you. The aim of this to enable shared scrutiny of what is being built (and

  in peoples' communities.

  <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com">PlanningAlerts.com</a>, built by Richard Pope, Mikel Maron, Sam Smith,
  Duncan Parkes, Tom Hughes and Andy Armstrong.
