  Why do I need to disclose if I've made a donation to a Councillor and/or gift to a Councillor or Council employee
  when commenting on a planning application?

<dd>
  In NSW, for example, it is an offence if you fail to disclose this when making a submission under the
  <%= pa_link_to "Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979", "http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/epaaa1979389/s10.4.html" %>.
  If this applies to you, please ensure you contact the council responsible so that you can make this disclosure.
