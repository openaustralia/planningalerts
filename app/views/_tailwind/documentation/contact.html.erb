    Are you trying to get in touch with your local council or state planning authority?
    In that case please <strong>contact them directly</strong>.
    Unfortunately we can't help you with all that official stuff because Planning Alerts is completely independent from Government.
    Planning Alerts is a free service, built and maintained by a tiny charity,
    <%= pa_link_to "the OpenAustralia Foundation", "https://www.oaf.org.au/" %>.

  <p class="mt-6 text-2xl text-navy">
    To find the contact details for your council or state planning authority the best way is to find their official website and look there.
    Good luck!
