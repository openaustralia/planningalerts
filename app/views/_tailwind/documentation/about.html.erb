  About Planning Alerts

  You'd probably know if your next door neighbour was going to knock their house down (you'd get a letter through
  the door telling you they had applied for planning permission and asking you what you thought about it). But you'd
  probably never find out if the old cinema or pub 5 streets away is going to be converted into luxury flats until
  the bulldozers turned up.

<p class="mt-6 text-2xl text-navy">
  PlanningAlerts is a free service which searches as many planning authority websites as it can find and emails
  you details of applications near you. The aim of this to enable shared scrutiny of what is being built (and
