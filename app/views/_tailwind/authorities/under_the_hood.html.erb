  The steps
  <ol class="pl-6 ml-3 text-2xl list-decimal list-outside text-navy">
    <li>
      Applications are published on the
      <%= @authority.full_name %>
      website in a human readable, non-structured form.
    </li>
    <li>
      The latest scraper code on Github is loaded by our scraping
      platform <%= pa_link_to "morph.io", "https://morph.io" %>.

      The
      <%= pa_link_to "scraper #{@authority.morph_name}", morph_url(@authority) %>

      <%= pa_link_to "morph.io", "https://morph.io" %>
      collects the information daily and converts it into a machine-readable
      format.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the scraper errors anyone who is
      <%= pa_link_to "watching the scraper", morph_watchers_url(@authority) %>
      on morph.io gets informed via a daily email alert.
    </li>
    <li>
      The machine readable data is
      <%= pa_link_to "validated, imported and geocoded", anchor: "import" %>
      by PlanningAlerts daily. If there are any validation errors on an
      application, the application is skipped and the error is logged.
      See below for the most recent logs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The information is published on PlanningAlerts, made available via the
      <%= pa_link_to "API", api_howto_path %>, and people are informed of new
      applications via email alerts.
