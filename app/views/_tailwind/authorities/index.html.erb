      To be able to display and send alerts for planning applications,
      Planning Alerts needs to download applications from as many councils as possible.
      As the vast majority of councils don't supply the data in a reusable, machine-readable format
      we write web scrapers for each local government authority. These scrapers fetch the data from
      council web pages and present it in a structured format so we can load it into the
      Planning Alerts database.
