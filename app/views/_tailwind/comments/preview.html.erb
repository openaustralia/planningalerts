        We are not against development of the site in general, however the house seems
        excessive in size and adversely impacts on the adjoining properties in particular
        but also on the immediate area. This new house will block out all direct afternoon
        sunlight for our entire backyard due to its size. Similarly, number 3 Agate Ave
        will have the same problem but in the morning to midday period. It seems unfair
        for two properties to both lose half their backyard sunlight due to the size of
        the new dwelling.
