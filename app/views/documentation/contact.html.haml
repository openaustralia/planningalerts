%h4 Contact a planning authority

%p
  Are you trying to get in touch with your local council or state planning authority?
  In that case you need to <strong>contact them directly</strong>.
  We can't help you with all that official stuff because Planning Alerts is not affiliated with or a part of the Government.
  Planning Alerts is a free service, run in the public interest by a charity, the OpenAustralia Foundation.

%p
  To find the contact details for your council or state planning authority the best way is to find their official website and look there.
  Good luck!
