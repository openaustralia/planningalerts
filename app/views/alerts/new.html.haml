%p#privacy
  Our
  %em Privacy Policy
  is very simple: We will not sell or distribute any personal information
  you share with us - at all, ever.

%p.explanation
  It's possible your local authority may not be included yet. If you want you can
  #{link_to "check", authorities_path}. If it isn't, please sign up
  anyway and you'll receive alerts as soon as they're available. Also, the more people have signed up in a particular area, the harder we'll work to cover that area.
