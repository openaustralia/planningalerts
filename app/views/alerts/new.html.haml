  Our
  %b Privacy Policy
  is very simple: We will not sell or distribute any personal information
  you share with us &mdash; at all, ever.

%p It's possible your local authority may not be included yet. If you want you can #{link_to "check", authorities_path}. If it isn't, please sign up anyway and you'll receive alerts as soon as they're available. Also, the more people have signed up in a particular area, the harder we'll work to cover that area.
