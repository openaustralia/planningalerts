# Models

This is an example of a **Typus** enabled model with all available options.
You can use this example to customize your YAML files which only have set the
most common settings.

    Post:
      fields:
        default: id, title, category_id, created_at, is_published?
        list: id, title, category_id, created_at, is_published?
        form: title, body, is_published?, created_at
        show: title, category, is_published?
        relationship: title, status
        options:
          auto_generated:
          booleans:
            is_published: ["Yes, it is", "No, it isn't"]
          date_formats:
            created_at: post_long
          selectors:
          read_only:
          filter_by_date_range: valid_until
          templates:
            body: rich_text
      actions:
        index: cleanup
        edit: send_as_newsletter
        show: rebuild
      export: csv, xml
      order_by: created_at
      relationships:
      filters: is_published?, created_at, category_id
      search: title, body
      application: Application
      description: Some text to describe the model
      options:
        action_after_save: index
        default_action_on_item: show
        end_year: 2015
        form_rows: 25
        minute_step: 15
        nil: 'nil'
        only_user_items: true
        per_page: 5
        start_year: 1990

Note: To define namespace models use :: as a separator. (i.e. Delayed::Job)

# Roles

In this file you can configure the actions available for each of your models
on the application. You can also use the 'all' shortcut to allow the user the
access to all actions.

    admin:
      Post: create, read, update, delete
      Category: create, read, update, delete
      TypusUser: all

    editor:
      Post: create, read, update
      Category: read, update

You can also define `resources` which are not related to a model, for example
to control `Redis`.

    admin:
      Redis: index, flush_all
