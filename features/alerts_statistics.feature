Feature: Show statistics on alerts
  In order to figure out which scrapers to write first
  As a scraper developer
  I want to see how many people have signed up for alerts in each area and whether that area has a scraper written for it already
  
  Scenario: list all the email alerts by authority
    Given the following email alerts:
      | email                  | address                     | radius_meters |
      | foo@openaustralia.org  | 200 Darley Street, Newtown  | 2000          |
      | foo@bar.org            | 100 Govett Street, Katoomba | 1000          |
      | test@openaustralia.org | 100 Bathurst Road, Katoomba | 2000          |
    And the following development applications:
      | address                     | council_reference | scraper        |
      | 100 Govett Street, Katoomba | 001               | Blue Mountains |
    When I go to the alerts statistics page
    Then I should see "Marrickville, NSW 1"
    And I should not see "Blue Mountains, NSW"
