      <x-application address="6 Kahibah Road, Umina Beach, NSW">
        S4.55 to Modify Approved Dwelling and Garage including Deletion of Clerestory,

        Expansion of Workshop

    <p>
      It has recently come to my attention that a planning application has been submitted
      for 813 Hight Street, Reservoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      My concern is with the application for ground floor shops and nine (9) dwellings,
      above, with a reduction in the car parking requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, there are already parking issues in the area, with insufficient parking
      bays available. Residents of Wild Street and Henry Street are constantly complaining
      about cars parked on "their" street. We often find abusive notes left on vehicles,
      harassment of staff when in the street, and stupid acts of vandalism. We are a
      business on High Street and staff already have difficulty finding parking as it
      is. It appears that the council is not concerned for its local businesses or residents
      and allowing a new building with reduced parking is irresponsible and inconsiderate.
      I understand that the council and developers want to make as much money as possible but
      it is extremely unfair to cause such distress and inconvenience to everyone else.
      I strongly oppose such a development and would like further information as to how to
      make this a formal objection.
